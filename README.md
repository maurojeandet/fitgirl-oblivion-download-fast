## Playwright based downloader for fitgirl oblivion (could change)
`npm install`

#### To run:
`npx playright test --ui`
I see `--ui` most beneficial to have a visual representation but could run without it.

Before running `npx playwright test` with or without `--ui you may need update `tests/example.spec.js ln:5` with your desire download path.
